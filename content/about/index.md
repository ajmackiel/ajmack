My research interests broadly span the topic of human evolutionary biology and cultural evolution. Most centrally, I am interested in the evolutionary basis of human social behavior. I am interested in how culture, social norms, and morality function to produce and maintain cooperative and coordinated social behavior.

I graduated from Carleton College with a B.A. in Psychology and English. There, I conducted research in a behavioral neuroscience lab studying motivation and reward in female rats.

Currently, I’m a M.S. in Psychological Sciences student at SUNY New Paltz. I am also a Research Assistant for the [Culture, Cognition, and Coevolution Lab](https://coevolution.fas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology.

At SUNY New Paltz I do research in the Evolutionary Psychology Lab and the Social Development Lab. I’ve also been a TA for Research Methods in Psychology, Psychology Statistics, and the Evolutionary Studies Seminar.

 In addition to being an evolutionary behavioral scientist, I am interested in science writing and have written for online blogs and magazines. I have published articles in the popular online magazine, Quillette, as well as in Psychology Today about mind and behavior.
