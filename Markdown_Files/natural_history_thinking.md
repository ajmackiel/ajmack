# Notes on _A Natural History of Human Thinking_

The author, Michael Tomasello, explains the three key components of great ape thinking:

#### 1. Schematic and cognitive representations
#### 2. Causal and intentional inferences
#### 3. Behavioral self-monitoring
Schematic and cognitive representations refers to the ability to work with some kind of abstract cogntive representations, to which the individual assimilates particular experiences. In other words, being able to form abstract cognitive representations of, for example, a food item that has been moved to a different location or is likely to be at a specific location. 

Causal and intentional inferences refer to the ability to make inferences from cognitive representations. In other words, using one's representations, schemas, and cognitive models to make inferences about nonactual situations, for instance, representing the states of minds of other more dominant apes in regards to a food item that is in public view. The subordinate ape likely will infer that if they attempt to eat the food item, they may be hurt by the dominant ape. 

Lastly, behavioral self-monitroing refers to the ability to self-monitor the descision-making process. In other words, being able to stand back and away from the way one makes a decsision and therefore realize the inadequacy of their knowledge or at least the narrowness of their beliefs and knowledge when it comes to certain domains of life. 

Tomasello's crucial point here is that well before the emergence of uniquely human sociality, much less culture, language, and institutions, the foundations for human thinking were in place in human's last common ancestor with apes. 

A significant difference between ape thinking and human thinking is that in apes, social cognition mainly evolved for competing with others in the social group, ultimately favoring behaviors that situate them higher in the status hierarchy within their community. On the other hand, human sociality is much more cooperatively organized, favoring shared over individual intentionality. 



He writes,
>_A change in ecology led to some new forms of collaboration, which required for their coordination some new forms of cooperative communication, and then together these created the possibility that, during ontogeny, individuals could construct through their social interactions with others some new forms of cogntive representations, inference, and self-monitoring for use in their thinking._
