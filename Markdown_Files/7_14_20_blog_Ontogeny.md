# Notes from *Becoming Human: A Theory of Ontogeny*

Early on humans, in contrast to great apes, display psychological adaptations for mental coordination, which restruture human cognition in several ways over development. Starting approximately at nine months of age, children engage with others in acts of joint attentionâ€”that is, infant A attends to X, knows that infant B is also attending to X, and also represents a shared "we" that together, A and B are looking at X.

Joint attention creates the capacity of conceputlaizing entities and situations simultaneously from varying perspectives. 

In contrast to humans, apes do not bifurcate their experience into subjective and objective or appeearance and reality or belief and truth. They just have the latter term in each pairing, all-pervasive subjectivity against which they have nothing to contrast it.
