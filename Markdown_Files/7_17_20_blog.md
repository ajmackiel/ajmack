# Cultural Evolution of Genetic Heritability
- "When a genome wide association study (GWAS) identifies genes for intelligence, prosociality, or longevity, those genes should not be assumed to be valid beyond a specific people living in a specific environment, in a specific time."
- "This argument goes beyond simply a mismatch between genes and culture. Instead, genes can only be evaluated with respect to the cultural environment in which they are expressed. For this reason, heritability is less a property of a trait, and more a combined measure of features of the environment including culture, their respective variances, and the causal relationship between genes and traits."
